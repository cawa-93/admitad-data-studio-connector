This [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com) [Community
Connector](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector) lets users query
the [Admitad](https://admitad.com/) advertiser reports.

## Getting started

    ```
1. Click `Validate` and choose `Admitad connector` bellow.

### Authorization
At the first authorization you can receive a warning "This app isn't verified". This is normal.

In this window, click **"Advanced"** and then **"Go to Admitad Connector (unsafe)"** to continue authorization. You can always revoke access in the same manner as for [any connector](https://support.google.com/datastudio/answer/9053467).
