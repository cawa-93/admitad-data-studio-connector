**The project is being developed by sponsors on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Kozack)**.

the [Admitad](https://admitad.com/) advertiser reports.

## Getting started

### Authorization
At the first authorization you will receive a warning that this connector has never been tested by Google employees. This is normal.
